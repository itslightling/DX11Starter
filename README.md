# DX11 Playground

A WIP playground / rudimentary graphics engine for a class

Class: 2215.IGME.540.01 - Foundations of Game Graphics Programming

Normally I have school projects on a separate account, but decided a solo advanced c++ project would be fine on my primary account ( @xLightling )

## Controls

WASD - Directional Camera Movement (Locally Oriented)
Q/E - Move Up/Down (Globally Oriented)
R/F - Look Up/Down (Pitch)
Z/C - Look Left/Right (Yaw)
1 - Load Scene 1 (Surrealist WeirdScape)
2 - Load Scene 2 (Material Test Scene)
